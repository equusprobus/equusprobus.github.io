It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. 

"It is a small part of life we really live."

Vices surround and assail men from every side, and do not allow them to rise again and lift their eyes to discern the truth, but keep them overwhelmed and rooted in their desires. 

Among the worst offenders I count those who spend all their time in drinking and lust, for these are the worst preoccupations of all. 

No activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is preoccupied - Not rhetoric or liberal studies - since the mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply.

Learning how to live takes a whole life, and which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die. 

So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a raging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and riven round and round in a circle by the rage of opposing winds? He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about. 

You have been preoccumpied while life hastens on. 

Some men are preoccupied even in their leisure: in their country house, on their couch, in the midst of solitude, even when quite alone, they are their own worst company. 

Of all people only those are at leisure 

*(Book One - Information In War)*


As long as his men are full of good courage
