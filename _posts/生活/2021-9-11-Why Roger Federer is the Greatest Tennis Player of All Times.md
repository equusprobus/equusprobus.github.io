In my eyes, Roger Federer is the greatest tennis player of all times. I say this not because he won 20 Grand Slams, but because what he has contributed to tennis as a sport. 

Right after Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, he became unbeatable and dominated the tennis world by wining most of the Grand Slams in the next couple of years. Why? My understanding is that he discovered the role of wrist in tennis playing and unleashed a new power that was never known to previous players. Before him, when a player hit a ball, he moves his legs, his body, and his arms. Roger added wrist. That is why when other players hit a ball, he whips it. This makes his forehand so fluid and so powerful yet without a big swing of the racket. This is also part of the reason that he can make so many incredile shots on the spot as flipping your wrist involves much less movements therefore you can repond to a fast ball quickly. 

Roger is great also because he is the last person that plays both the old era serve-and-volley and the new era baseline rallys, and he perfects those skills in both world. Roger's serve is clean, precise, and effective, absolutely a beauty to watch. His touch at net is probably only comparable by the best ever serve-and-volley player Pete Sampras. And for baseline rallys, in my eyes Roger is the player who mixed top-spin and flat perfectly, which is part of the reasons that at his prime he was both the best offensive player and the best defensive player of the world. 

Roger's unique and greatest contribution to tennis is that he turns tennis from sport to an art. The level of skill and aesthetics that he demonstrates on the tennis court prompts jounalists decribing watching his games as a "religious experience".
