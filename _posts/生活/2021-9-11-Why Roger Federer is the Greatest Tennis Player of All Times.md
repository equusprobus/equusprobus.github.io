In my eyes, Roger Federer is the greatest tennis player of all times. I say this not because he won 20 Grand Slams, but because what he has contributed to tennis as a sport. 

Right after Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, he became unbeatable and dominated the tennis world by wining most of the Grand Slams in the next couple of years. Why? My understanding is that he discovered the role of wrist in tennis playing and unleashed a new power that was never known to previous players. Before him, when a player hit a ball, he moves his legs, his body, and his arms. Roger added wrist. That is why when other players hit a ball, he whips it. This makes his forehand so fluid and so powerful yet without a big swing of the racket. This is also part of the reason that he can make so many incredile shots on the spot as flipping your wrist involves much less movements therefore you can repond to a fast ball quickly.
