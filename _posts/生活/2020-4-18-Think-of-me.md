Think of me, think of me fondly  
When we've said goodbye  
Remember me, every so often  
Please promise me you'll try  

On that day, on that not so distant day  
when you're far away and free  
If you ever find a moment  
Spare a thought for me  

And though it is clear, though it was always clear  
that this was never meant to be  
If you happen to remember  
Stop and think of me  
 
Think of August  
When the world was green  
Don't think about the way  
Things might have been  

Think of me, think of me waking  
Silent and resigned  
Imagine me trying too hard  
To put you from my mind  

Think of me, please say you'll think of me  
Whatever you choose to do  
There will never be a day   
When I won't think of you   

Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade   
They have their seasons so do we     
But please promise me that sometimes   
You will think  
of me
