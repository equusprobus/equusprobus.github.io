Roger Federer is my favorite tennis player. It is not because he won 20 grand slams but because what he has contributed to tennis as a sport and the way he plays. 

Right after Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, he became unbeatable and dominated the tennis world by wining most of the Grand Slam titles in the next couple of years. Why? My understanding is that he discovered the role of wrist in tennis playing and unleashed a new power that was never known to previous players. Before him, when a player hit a ball, he moves his legs, his body, and his arms. Roger added wrist. So While other players _hit_ a ball, he _whips_ it. This makes his forehand so fluid and so powerful yet without a big swing of the racket. Most of his rivals back then couldn't find a solution to his game because of this.  

Roger Federer is the last person that plays both the old era serve-and-volley and the new era baseline rallys, and he perfects those skills in both worlds. Roger's serve is clean, precise, and effective, absolutely a beauty to watch. His touch at net is probably only comparable by the best ever serve-and-volley player Pete Sampras. And for baseline rallys, in my eyes Roger is the player who mixed top-spin and flat perfectly, which makes him both the best offensive player and the best defensive player at the same time during his prime. 

Roger's unique and greatest contribution to tennis is that he turns tennis from sport to an art. The level of aesthetics and grace that he demonstrates on the tennis court prompts jounalists decribing watching his games a "religious experience". The awe and wonder from witnessing his impossible shots, his flawless glide over the count, his ease at handling all incoming balls, even his focus, composure, and facial expression when striking the ball, all make you feel joy and satisfaction deep in your heart, sometimes so strong that only a religious ecstasy can be comparable to that experience. 

In my eyes, Roger is irreplaceable 'cause no one can ever play like that. No matter how many grand slams other players may get, to me he is simply the greatest tennis player of all times and the one I will always admire and love.
